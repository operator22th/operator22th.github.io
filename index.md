## About Me

I am currently a third-year undergruduate at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), pursuing a degree in Information and Computing Science.

In the summer of 2023, I joined [THUML](https://github.com/thuml) under the supervision of [Prof. Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/). In the summer of 2024, I began a research internship at [Lecar Lab](https://lecar-lab.github.io/), under the guidance of [Prof. Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me/).

My research aims to develop general algorithms that empower agents to learn efficiently in sequential, interactive, and dynamic environments. Currently, I am particularly excited about exploring effective deep learning methods for physical scene understanding and general-purpose world modeling.
